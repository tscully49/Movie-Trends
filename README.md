The purpose of ths project is to plug use and analyze statistics from Rotten Tomatoes API, and to display that data in an interesting and entertaining manner.

Use a command line (GitBash will work just fine) 

Go into our project folder (Ex. C:\Users\Thomas\Desktop\Movie-Trends)

Type "npm start" 
(you should see something like "> Movie-Trends@0.0.0 start c:\Users\Thomas\Desktop\Movie-Trends
								> node ./bin/www")

Then go to your web browser and type "localhost:3000" into the url and hit enter

If all goes well, you will see the page.
